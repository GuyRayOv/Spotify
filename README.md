Machine Learning Pipeline Project

This repository contains a complete, modular machine learning pipeline, developed using a Kaggle dataset. The original dataset documentation is available at:
{REPOSITORY_PATH}/data/README.md

📘 Project Overview
The project implements all major stages of a supervised machine learning workflow, including:
1) Data Preparation – loading, cleaning, and structuring the raw dataset.
2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – statistical summaries, visualization, and feature insights.
3) Data Cleansing – outlier detection and imputation of missing values.
4) Feature Engineering & Selection – feature transformation, encoding, and importance ranking.
5) Model Selection & Hyperparameter Optimization – model evaluation and tuning using Grid Search.

Each stage is implemented in a dedicated Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) to ensure modularity, clarity, and reproducibility.

⚙️ Notebook Workflow
Notebooks are cascading each other. Where Notebook N executes notebook N-1 first, and loads its serialized output (N-1.pkl). 
Each stage/notebook can also be re-run independently, promoting flexibility and reproducibility.

A centralized configuration file {REPOSITORY_PATH}/src/config.json defines all global parameters, including: File paths, Execution order,
Algorithms for outlier detection, imputation, and modeling. And Pipeline control flags (e.g., "split_df", chain_notebooks)

🧠 Data Leakage Prevention
To ensure robust evaluation and prevent data leakage, the Kaggle dataset is split into two independent subsets:
Training DataFrame (df)
Testing DataFrame  (df_test)
Both are processed independently through the pipeline.
This behavior is controlled via the "split_df" flag in config.json.
