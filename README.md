This is an ML project based on Kaggle's dataset. the project includes the classic steps of the ML pipeline, including: data preperation, eda, outliers detection, impute, feature engineering, model selecton, and grid reserach.

Each step of the ML pipeline is coded on a seperate notebook (.ipynb):
1) date prep
2) eda
3) cleansing (outliers, imput)
4) feature engneering/selection
5) model selection and grid reaserch

Each notebook (N) execute its previous notebook (N+1) before executing itself, while dropping .pkl files for notebook N+1 to continue the execution from.
